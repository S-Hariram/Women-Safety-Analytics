# SHEild: Empowering Women’s Safety Through Technology

## 🚨 Project Overview
**SHEild** is an open-source, non-profit initiative dedicated to creating a safer environment for women in workplaces and society. By leveraging advanced machine learning and computer vision technologies, SHEild detects incidents of sexual harassment in real-time via CCTV cameras, automatically generating reports that are sent to the nearest authorities for swift action.

**SHEild** was started by Sahil Thakur, Pranav Sharma, and Karanjot Singh Malhotra, Ashish , Sneha , Vimal Thakur who share a common vision of utilizing technology to ensure women’s safety and empower their contributions to society.

## 📝 Problem Statement
Women play a critical role in every sector of society, contributing to fields such as healthcare, technology, education, and beyond. However, the reality is stark: data from 2018 to 2021 reveals that 27,000 to 161,000 cases of sexual harassment in workplaces were officially reported. The true number is likely much higher, as many cases go unreported due to fear of judgment or other societal pressures.

Isn't it our responsibility to create a safer place for women to live, work, and contribute to society? SHEild aims to fulfill this responsibility by ensuring women’s safety through cutting-edge technology.

## 💡 Solution
SHEild is a tool designed to safeguard women in workplaces and public spaces. Our AI-driven software detects incidents of sexual harassment by analyzing CCTV footage, then generates and sends automated reports that include:
- **Location of the incident**
- **Exact timing**
- **Visual evidence (images of the incident)**

These reports are immediately forwarded to the nearest concerned authorities, allowing them to take prompt and appropriate action.

## 🌍 Vision
Our vision is to utilize technology to create safer workplaces and societal environments for women. By doing so, we aim to empower women to contribute fully to the economy and society without fear of harassment or violence.

## ✨ Why SHEild?
Women are the backbone of our society, making significant contributions in every sector. Yet, the alarming rise in sexual harassment cases highlights a grave issue that must be addressed. SHEild is our solution to this problem—a tool that not only detects but also helps prevent harassment, ensuring women can work and live safely.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Data Processing:** Custom scripts for dataset scraping and augmentation

## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of 3000 images, equally divided between positive cases (sexual harassment) and negative cases. This balanced dataset ensures the model's accuracy in distinguishing between harmful and non-harmful behavior.
